The **Biome Capsule** and **Biome Painter** are used together to allow you to change the biome of a location.

Throw the Biome Capsule on the ground, and it will absorb points of the biome it's in.

Hold the Biome Painter in-hand to see what blocks nearby are not the same biome as the first non-empty Capsule in your inventory. Right-click the Painter on those blocks to change it, spending the biome points.
