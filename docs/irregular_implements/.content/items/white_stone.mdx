The **White Stone** has the power to prevent your death once while charged. Doing so fully discharges the item.

Charge the item by exposing it to the light of the full moon, either by dropping it on the ground or holding it while standing outside. The moon must also be at its peak.

It can be rarely found in dungeon chests.
