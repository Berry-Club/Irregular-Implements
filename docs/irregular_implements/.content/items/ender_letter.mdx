The **Ender Letter** allows you to send items to other players more easily. It can store up to 9 stacks inside itself.

In its GUI, type the recipient's username. Then, simply use it on any [Ender Mailbox](@irregular_implements:ender_mailbox). If the recipient's Mailbox is not full, it will be placed inside it.
