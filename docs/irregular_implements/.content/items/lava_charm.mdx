The **Lava Charm** can be worn as a Curio, and adds a temporary lava shield. It is visible above your armor bar.

While the shield is full, you will be completely immune to lava damage. Note that it does not protect you from fire damage, only lava damage.

It may be wise to also invest in an [Obsidian Skull](@irregular_implements:obsidian_skull) to protect against fire damage.

Lava Charms can be found rarely in dungeon chests, and more commonly in Nether Fortress chests.
