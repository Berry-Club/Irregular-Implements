There is a **Divining Rod** for each ore (that is, any block/item that has a tag beginning with `#c:ores/`). When held in-hand, nearby ores of that type will be visible through walls.

<Callout variant="danger">
	The custom render type that this uses is currently not compatible with Sodium! It won't crash, but the ores won't be highlighted.
	</Callout>

The same recipe can be used for any ore type, just substituting the actual ore itself. It follows this pattern:

```
OSO
SES
S S
```
where `O` is the ore block, `S` is a Stick, and `E` is a Spider Eye.

You can also craft a universal Divining Rod that works for all ores!
