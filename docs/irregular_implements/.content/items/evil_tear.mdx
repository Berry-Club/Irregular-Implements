The **Evil Tear** can be used to make an Artificial End Portal.

Make the following structure (the End Rod is 3 blocks above the Obsidian, 4 above the End Stone), and then use the Tear on the End Rod.

An End Portal will grow in the ring, and will function exactly as expected. Breaking any of these blocks will break the Portal.
