**Floo Tokens** allow you to use [Floo teleportation]($players/floo_teleportation) from anywhere in the world.

Throw it on the ground and wait several seconds. It will spawn a Temporary Floo Fireplace, which will allow you to teleport to any named Floo Fireplace.

While this will not take any [Floo Powder]($irregular_implements:floo_powder), it *will* use up the Token.
