The **Portkey** is used to teleport whoever picks it up.

Right-click the Portkey on a block to set its destination. Then, throw it on the ground. After a short delay, it will activate.

Anyone who touches the activated Portkey will be teleported instantly to the destination, assuming it's in the same dimension.

You can craft the Portkey with any other item to disguise it, making it look like the item it was crafted with.
