**Ectoplasm** is a material that drops when Spirits are killed.

Spirits have a chance of spawning any time a mob dies. The chance increases the closer it is to the full moon, and increases further if the Ender Dragon has ever been killed on the server.

Spirits can only be damaged via magic. This includes Splash Potions, enchanted items, and certain other items like the [Spectre Sword](@irregular_implements:spectre_tools).
