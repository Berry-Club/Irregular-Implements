**Spectre Chargers** are used to charge items in your inventory with FE from your [Spectre Energy Buffer](@irregular_implements:spectre_energy_injector).

While active, it will charge every item in your inventory, including armor and Curio slots.

Each tier charges faster than the last. The **Genesis Spectre Charger** is creative only, and does not use your Spectre Energy Buffer's energy.
