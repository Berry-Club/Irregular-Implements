**Water Walking Boots** allow you to walk on water. Wow!

They do not work while already underwater, and are disabled while sneaking.

<Callout variant="danger">
	Note that walking on water means that you can also LAND on water, causing fall damage!

They can only be found in [chests](@irregular_implements:water_chest) in Ocean Monuments.
