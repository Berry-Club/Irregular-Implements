The **Redstone Remote** acts like the [Redstone Activator](@irregular_implements:redstone_activator), but can be used from a distance.

It can have up to 9 stored locations. Sneak right-click it to open its GUI, and insert set [Location Filters](@irregular_implements:location_filter). You can place an item in the slot above to give its button an icon.

Right-click while not sneaking to access the location buttons. Click the button to pulse its location for a short duration.
