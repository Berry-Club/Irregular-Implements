The **Item Filter** has a list of up to 9 items, and can serve as either a Whitelist or a Blacklist. Toggle this using the button on the far right of the GUI.

Above each filled slot is two buttons.

The left button allows you to toggle if the slot is an Item Filter or a Tag Filter. For example, putting a Stick in the slot will by default make it filter for the `minecraft:stick` item. Changing it to a Tag Filter will make it filter one of Stick's item tags.

The right button's function changes depending on if the slot is an Item Filter or a Tag Filter.

For Item Filter slots, it toggles whether or not the item must match the data components (like enchantments, custom names, etc) of the item in the slot.

For Tag Filter slots, it cycles which of the item's tags to filter for.
