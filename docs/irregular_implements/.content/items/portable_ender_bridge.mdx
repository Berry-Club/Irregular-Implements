While held in the hand, you'll be able to see nearby Ender Bridges through blocks. Simply right-click while looking at an Ender Anchor to teleport to it.

	The custom render type that this uses is currently not compatible with Sodium! It won't crash, but the Ender Anchors won't be visible through walls.
