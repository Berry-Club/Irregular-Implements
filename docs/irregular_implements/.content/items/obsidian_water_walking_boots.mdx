**Obsidian Water Walking Boots** combine the effects of the [Water Walking Boots](@irregular_implements:water_walking_boots) and the [Obsidian Skull](@irregular_implements:obsidian_skull).

Get them by combining the two in an Anvil.

Note that this does not let you walk on Lava! You'll have to use the [Lava Waders](@irregular_implements:lava_waders) for that.
