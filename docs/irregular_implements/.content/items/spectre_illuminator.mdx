The **Spectre Illuminator** can be used on a block to fully light up the chunk it's in.

It will place an entity that slowly floats upwards, aiming to be just above the highest block in the chunk.

This can be undone by either right-clicking the Illuminator entity, or by using **Blackout Powder** in the chunk.
