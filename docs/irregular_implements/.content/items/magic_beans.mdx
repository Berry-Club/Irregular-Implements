## Lesser Magic Bean

**Lesser Magic Beans** can be planted to make a Bean Stalk that grows upwards until it's blocked by something. It can be climbed like a ladder!

## Magic Bean

The non-lesser **Magic Bean** is a much more powerful version. They grow much, much faster, and will break (almost) any block in their way.

Once it reaches the top of the world (or if it wouldn't be able to grow further), it will place a **Bean Pod** at its top. Break it open to collect some rare loot!

The Magic Bean cannot be crafted. Instead, it can be found in dungeon loot and [Nature Core](@irregular_implements:nature_core) chests.
