### Available Imbues

- **Fire Imbue**: Melee attacks set targets on fire.
- **Poison Imbue**: Melee attacks inflict Poison II.
- **Wither Imbue**: Melee attacks inflict Wither II.
- **Experience Imbue**: Double experience from slain mobs.
- **Spectre Imbue**: 10% chance to completely negate incoming damage.
- **Collapse Imbue**: Melee attacks inflict [Collapse](@irregular_implements:sakanade_spores).
