The **Stable Ender Pearl** is used to teleport a bound player in a more controlled way.

Right-click the Pearl to bind it to you. After seven seconds of sitting on the ground as an item entity, it will teleport the bound player to its location, and break.

If there is no bound player, it will instead teleport a random nearby entity within 10 blocks.
