The **Pitcher Plant** generates an infinite amount of water. It can be found in wet biomes in the overworld.

Clicking a bucket or other fluid receptacle will fill it with Water.

Placing it adjacent to a tank will fill the tank with water, at a configurable speed. You can also pipe water from it, also at a configurable speed.
