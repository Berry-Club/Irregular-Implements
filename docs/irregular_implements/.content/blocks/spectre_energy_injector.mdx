Every player has their own Spectre Energy Buffer, which acts sort of like an Ender Chest for FE. By default, it can store 1,000,000 FE.

Energy can be inserted into a player's Buffer via the **Spectre Energy Injector**. Whoever placed the Injector is whose Buffer gets filled.

You cannot extract from the Injector. Instead, you'll have to use either a [Spectre Coil](@irregular_implements:spectre_coil) or a [Spectre Charger](@irregular_implements:spectre_charger).
