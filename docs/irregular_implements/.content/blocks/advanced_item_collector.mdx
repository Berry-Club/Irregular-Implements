The **Advanced Item Collector** is an upgraded version of the [Item Collector](@irregular_implements:item_collector). Its collection volume is configurable, ranging from 0 to 10 blocks in each direction.

Each axis (X/Y/Z) can be configured independently, as well.

Additionally, you can insert an [Item Filter](@irregular_implements:item_filter), and it will only collect items that match the filter.
