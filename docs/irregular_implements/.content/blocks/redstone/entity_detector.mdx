The **Entity Detector** emits a redstone signal when an entity matching its filter is within its detection area.

In its GUI you can set the radius in each dimension, if the signal is inverted or not, and specify what type of entity to detect.

You can choose to detect:
- All Entities
- Living Entities
- Animals
- Monsters
- Players
- Items
- Custom

When in Custom mode, it will use an inserted [Entity Filter](@irregular_implements:entity_filter).
