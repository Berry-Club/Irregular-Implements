The **Inventory Tester** must be placed on an inventory, and stores an item in itself.

It will emit a redstone signal if the inventory is capable of accepting that item.

It also checks the *side* of the inventory it's attached to. If placed on top of a Furnace, it will only work if the Furnace can accept the item into its top.

Because of that, you may want to also use the [Inventory Rerouter](@irregular_implements:inventory_rerouter).

You can invert it in its GUI, so it emits a signal when the inventory *can't* accept the item.
