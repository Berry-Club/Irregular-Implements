## Chat Detector

The **Chat Detector** emits a redstone pulse when the player that places it says a specific phrase in chat.

Set the phrase in its GUI. It's actually a RegEx field, so you can do more advanced filters. Just typing in the exact phrase is enough, however.

You can also toggle if the message gets canceled or not.

## Global Chat Detector

The **Global Chat Detector** works the same way, but listens to chat messages from every player instead of only its owner.

It can only cancel messages from its owner, however.
