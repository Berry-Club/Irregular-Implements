## Platforms

**Platforms** are solid from the top, but not from the bottom or sides.

Additionally, sneaking will allow you to fall through them.

<ProjectRecipe id="irregular_implements:oak_platform"/>

## Super Lubricant Platform

The **Super Lubricant Platform** works the same, but works like other [Super Lubricated blocks](@irregular_implements:super_lubricated_blocks) and negates all friction.

This makes it very useful for transporting items.

<ProjectRecipe id="irregular_implements:super_lubricant_platform"/>

## Filtered Super Lubricant Platform

The **Filtered Super Lubricant Platform** works the same, but can hold an [Item Filter](@irregular_implements:item_filter).

Anything matching the filter will fall through the platform.
