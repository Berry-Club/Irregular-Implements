The **Ender Mailbox** allows you to send and receive [Ender Letters](@irregular_implements:ender_letter) to and from other players.

To send a Letter, simply use it on any Mailbox, and it will be sent to the recipient if theirs is not full.

Using any Ender Mailbox will show your own incoming Letters, similar to an Ender Chest.
