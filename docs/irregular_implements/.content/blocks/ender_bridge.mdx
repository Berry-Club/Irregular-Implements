The **Ender Bridge** and **Prismarine Ender Bridge**, when powered by redstone, will teleport the entities above it towards the **Ender Anchor** it's aiming at.

It works through blocks, and across any distance (including unloaded chunks), as long as the Anchor is loaded. It has to be aiming DIRECTLY at the Anchor, as well.

When powered, it will look at every loaded Anchor and find the nearest one that it's aiming at. If there isn't one, it will audibly fail.

If there *is* an Anchor. it will charge up before activating. Its charge time depends on the distance, as well the tier of Bridge.

The regular Bridge takes 1 tick per block to charge, and the Prismarine Ender Bridge is twice as fast.
