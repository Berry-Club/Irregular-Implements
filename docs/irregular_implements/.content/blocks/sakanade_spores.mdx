**Sakanade Spores** can be found on the bottom of Large Brown Mushroom caps. When touched, Sakanade Spores will inflict the Collapse effect to entities.

For players, the Collapse effect inverts their movement and mouse controls.

For mobs, it instead confuses their pathfinding, causing them to move erratically.
