**Diaphanous Blocks** look like regular blocks at a distance, but vanishes as you approach, and can be walked through.

Craft a Diaphanous Block with any other block to set what it looks like.

Crafting a Diaphanous Block by itself will invert it, making it invisible at a distance and solid up close.
