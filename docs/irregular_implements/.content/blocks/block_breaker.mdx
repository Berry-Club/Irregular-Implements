## Block Breaker

The **Block Breaker** will break the block in front of it. It has the equivalent of an unbreakable Iron Pickaxe.

Blocks broken will be placed into an inventory behind it, if one exists. Otherwise, it will drop to the floor behind it.

It can be disabled with a redstone signal.

## Diamond Breaker

The **Diamond Breaker** can be applied to the Block Breaker to upgrade it, giving it the equivalent of a Diamond Pickaxe.

It can also be enchanted, and any enchantments will actually be applied when breaking blocks!
