The **Peace Candle** prevents hostile mobs from spawning within a radius around it. By default, this radius is a single chunk. That is, it effects a 3x3 chunk area centered on itself.

It can be disabled with a redstone signal.

Peace Candles can be found in certain Village temples. Where there would be a Brewing Stand, you can sometimes instead find a Peace Candle.
