## Regular Coils

**Spectre Coils** allow you to extract energy from your [Spectre Energy Buffer](@irregular_implements:spectre_energy_injector) wirelessly.

Each tier pulls a higher RF/t. Place the Coil directly on the machine you want to charge.

## Generator Coils

The **Spectre Coil Nr. 245** generates a small amount of RF/t for free, rather than using your Spectre Energy Buffer. It can be rarely found in dungeon chests.

The **Genesis Spectre Coil** is creative-only, and generates an infinite amount of RF/t.
