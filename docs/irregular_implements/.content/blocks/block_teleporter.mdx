The **Block Teleporter** allows you to teleport the block in front of itself to another Block Teleporter when powered.

Use a Location Filter to save the location of one Block Teleporter, and insert it into the inventory of a second Block Teleporter.

When that second Block Teleporter is powered, it will attempt to swap the block in front of itself with the block in front of the linked Block Teleporter.

Whether or not it works between different dimensions can be configured, and defaults to true.
