# Floo Teleportation

**Floo Teleportation** is a mechanic that allows you to teleport between certain structures called Floo Fireplaces.

## Floo Fireplaces

Make a Floo Fireplace by placing Bricks in the world and then using a Floo Sign on them. All of them will be converted to Floo Bricks that are part of the Fireplace.

Floo Fireplaces can have a name, which is how you teleport to it. Rename the Sign in an Anvil, and the Fireplace it creates will have that name.

Floo Fireplaces do not *have* to have a name, but if they don't, then you can't teleport to it. You'll still be able to teleport *from* it, though!

## Using

Stand on a Floo Fireplace and say the name of another. If you either have [Floo Powder](@irregular_implements:floo_powder) in-hand, or a non-empty [Floo Pouch](@irregular_implements:floo_pouch) anywhere in your inventory, you will be teleported to the Fireplace whose name you said.

You can only teleport to Fireplaces that are in the same dimension as you.

You don't have to get the name 100% correct! As long as you got it close enough, it'll work.

If you don't have access to a Floo Fireplace to teleport from, you can use a [Floo Token](@irregular_implements:floo_token) instead!
